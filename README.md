Diagnosis of Canine Skin Diseases

• Developed a robust image processing and skin diagnosis system for dog skin diseases using advanced 
  techniques like GLCM, HOG, and LBP.
• Applied machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifier, Nearest 
  Neighbors Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Voting Classifier to train and test the classification models.
• Conducted extensive experimentation and evaluation to achieve high accuracy in dog skin disease classification.
• Employed Boruta Feature Selection to identify and select the most relevant features, optimizing the 
  classification models and improving efficiency.
• Contributed to the field of veterinary medicine by developing an automated system for early detection and diagnosis
  of dog skin diseases, potentially improving the efficiency of treatment and reducing misdiagnosis
